# Docker / Get started / Swarms #

## Introduction ##

In [part 3 (services)](../services/README.md), you took an app you wrote in [part 2 (containers)](../containers/README.md), and defined how it should run in production by turning it into a service, scaling it up 5x in the process.

Here in part 4, you deploy this application onto a cluster, running it on multiple machines. Multi-container, multi-machine applications are made possible by joining multiple machines into a “Dockerized” cluster called a swarm.
