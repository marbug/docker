# Docker / Get started #

## Prerequisites ##

While weâ€™ll define concepts along the way, it is good for you to understand [what Docker is](../what-docker/README.md) and [why you would use Docker](../use-cases/README.md) before we begin.

## Setup ##

Before we get started, make sure your system has [the latest version of Docker installed](../engine/installation/README.md).

Note: version 1.13 or higher is required.

You should be able to run `docker run hello-world` and see a response like this:

    Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
    latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
    ca4f61b1923c: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:be0cd392e45be79ffeffa6b05338b98ebb16c87b255f48e297ec7f98e123905c
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
     1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
     2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (amd64)
     3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
     4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.

    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
     $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
