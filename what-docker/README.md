# Docker / What docker is #

## Overview ##

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

## Modern app platform ##

The Docker platform is the only container platform to build, secure and manage the widest array of applications from development to production both on premises and in the cloud. Docker Community Edition [CE] empowers developers with tools to build applications and Docker Enterprise Edition [EE] provides IT with multi-architecture operations at scale. Docker delivers both an engine for innovation that modernizes without disruption while reducing total costs by more than 50%. Unlike other solutions that specialize in a narrow slice of the enterprise IT portfolio, Docker delivers operations at scale by addressing a diverse set of applications and infrastructure for both developers and IT.
