# Docker / Quick start / Swarms #

## Understanding Swarm clusters ##

A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster. After that has happened, you continue to run the Docker commands youâ€™re used to, but now they are executed on a cluster by a **swarm manager**. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. After joining a swarm, they are referred to as **nodes**.
